Created, written, thrown together and generally mucked about by Thomas A.


This project is intended as an exercise in programming with C#.
Uses Visual Studio 19 Community and UWP.

The goal is to make an Application/UI that contains multiple relatively simple exercises.
These exercises are mainly experimentations and consist of me figuring things out as I go along.
Ofcourse, in the end it still has to do what is was meant to do, but the way in which things are handled may not necessarily be the best way.
Reasons for this may be that I thought a certain way was more valuable in terms of knowledge and experience, or that it might have a wider use-case.
Or because I lack(ed) the knowledge of how to do it a better way.
Or that I was having more fun doing it this way and couldn't be bothered to change it.

To that end, I have tried my best not to just copy-paste things (if I did so I should have added a link), and only look things up when necessary or I got stuck (in which case there may also be a link).




I do not own any of the assets used.
